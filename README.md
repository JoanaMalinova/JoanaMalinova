<h2>Hi , I'm Yoana :tulip:</h2>
<h3>Junior Front-end Developer </h3>
from Sofia, Bulgaria <br/>
I am a very positive, open-minded and curious person.<br/> 
<br/>
I began my tech education in SoftUni :woman_student: 

Now I'm onto furthering my knowledge, mainly in the sphere of Front-end developement.

I enjoy working with React and I am exited to show you my latest project with React and Firebase <a href="https://nemos-663db.web.app">NEMO's</a>
Also feel free to check out my <a href="https://portfolio-4946d.web.app">portfolio</a> . It is is still a work in progress, but mostly done.
