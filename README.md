### Hi , I'm Yoana Malinova :tulip: 
I am a Front End Web Developer in the makes. </br>

I am my  greatest critic and a perfectionist at that. </br>

I have strong drive for handling details right and aesthetically both in Visual Studion Code and in the Browser. </br>

:woman_student: I began my tech education in SoftUni , which started out as an experiment, but later on I found I really enjoyed coding. </br>

Now I'm onto furthering my knowledge, mainly in the sphere of Fron-End developement. </br>

My first love is React and i am thrilled to gradually increase my latest project -Nemos-
while I look into new features of React and React-router-dom and showing for it. </br>

Trying out different small projects with CSS and HTML got me into wanting to go in the way of Front End Developement, so I am also  a pure CSS and HTML enthusiast. </br>
As a second interest I find Angular very interesting, although also more trying. </br>

I see myself as widing my range of Front End frameworks and librariries in the futute as long as I find time for ot.

Outside of the tech world I have a lot of interest, which at this moment sadly I don't have time to embark in. <br/>

:mountain: I love hiking and going away from the city. The forest is sometimes the perfect place to reflect. :deciduous_tree: <br/>

If i find myself having more free time I would revisit my favourite games and  finally finish the Witcher 3. :smile: <br/>

:cat: Since my education is in the Veterinary field I also love animals, I have the most good behaved cat in the world at home. <br/>

:books: I like to read from times to times , mainly fantasy books. <br/>

:airplane: in the future i would love to go to far away places like Peru <br/>
