<h2>Hi , I'm Yoana :tulip:</h2>
<h3>Front-end Developer looking for Junior/Intern positions in the field </h3>
from Sofia, Bulgaria <br/>
I am a very positive, open-minded and curious person.<br/> 
<br/>
I began my tech education in SoftUni :woman_student: 

Now I'm onto furthering my knowledge, mainly in the sphere of Front-end developement.

I enjoy working with React and I am exited to show you my biggest project with React and Firebase <a href="https://nemos-663db.web.app">NEMO's</a>
Also feel free to check out my <a href="https://portfolio-4946d.web.app">portfolio</a> . Currently working on a fun project, inspired by the Withcher book, game and tv series. I plan on deploying it as soon as it grows a little. Meanwhile I am taking a course in Bootstrap, Typescript with React and React Native in Udemy.
