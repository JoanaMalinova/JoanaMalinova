<h1>Hi , I'm Yoana Malinova :tulip:</h1>
I am a Front End Web Developer in the makes, also  my  greatest critic and a perfectionist at that. 
With strong drive for handling details precisely and aesthetically both in Visual Studion Code and in the Browser.<br/> 
<br/>
:woman_student: I began my tech education in SoftUni , which started out as an experiment, but later on found I really enjoyed coding. 

Now I'm onto furthering my knowledge, mainly in the sphere of Fron-End developement. 

My first love is React and i am thrilled to gradually increase my latest project -Nemos-( https://nemos-663db.web.app)
while I look into new features of React and React-router-dom and showing for it. 

Trying out different small projects with CSS and HTML got me into wanting to go in the way of Front End Developement, so I am also a pure CSS and HTML enthusiast.

Outside of the tech world ...

:mountain: I love hiking and going away from the city. The forest is sometimes the perfect place to reflect. :deciduous_tree: 

If i find myself having more free time I would revisit my favourite games and  finally finish the Witcher 3. :smile: 

:cat: Since my education is in the Veterinary field I also love animals, I have the most good behaved cat in the world at home. 

:books: I like to read from times to times , mainly fantasy books. <br/>
